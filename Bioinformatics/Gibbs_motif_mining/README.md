## Gibbs Sampling Motif Mining 
Implementation of `Detecting Subtle Sequence Signals : A Gibbs Sampling Strategy for Multiple Alignment` by Lawrence et al, SCIENCE, 1993.

- Original paper uses amino acid sequences as examples, but here I used DNA base sequence. 
- Code should work with amino acid sequences with minor changes.
